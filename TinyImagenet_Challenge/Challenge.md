Need to achieve beyond validation accuracy of 45% on the TinyImagenet dataset under the following constraints:
1. Only Google Colab to be used for limited amount of computational resource
2. No dropout for regularization
3. No 1x1 to increase number of channels
4. No dense layer
5. Total number of epochs should be less than 500
